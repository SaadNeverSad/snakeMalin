### Run the Snake ###
To run the Snake, we need to run the python3 main.py command, but we have a set of variables to add to change the way our application works:

-s [score_max] is used to modify the maximum score at which we want to stop, the higher the score, the more time our Snake will take to calculate the path at the beginning of the application launch (we will explain why later)

-t [time_delay_between_each_move] is used to accelerate or slow down the speed of our Snake, the smaller the value, the faster our Snake will be

-d is used to debug our snake, this option is not mandatory, its purpose is to display all the positions where our snake will move

A runtime command might look like : python3 main.py -s 50 -t 10 -d

### How our AI works ###

To solve the Snake, we use the A* algorithm, the principle is to use a heuristic value (Manhattan distance between our head and the food), thus, our algorithm does not only take into account the arrival point, but also the set of possibilities already searched, using the distance between the departure and arrival points as a heuristic. We thus compute the set of possible paths and return the best (shortest) one. This path is stored in the form of tuples which are the set of positions in which it must move, then we display the result. (explaining the loading time which can last several seconds)

Our Astar function is available in the file Solver.py

Moreover, having added a food type, we make our AI choose the closest food

### Addition made in the game ####

To increase the difficulty, we have added the presence of walls, which are randomly generated at the beginning of the game, and which are intended to prevent our snake to make only diagonals or straight lines to reach the food, as it could do if there were no wall.
